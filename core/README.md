## ✨ What is Nearstack?

Nearstack is a local-first, zero-server framework for building beautiful modern apps—powered entirely by your browser. It’s designed to be:

- 🧠 **Composable** – Define modules, not endpoints
- 📦 **Self-contained** – All logic and data live client-side
- 💾 **Offline-first** – Apps work with or without internet
- 🌀 **Real-time** – Sync across peers with no backend
- 🛠️ **React + TypeScript** – Familiar, fast, and typed

Whether you're building a to-do app, a note-taking tool, or a fully featured productivity suite, Nearstack gives you everything you need to create **fully functioning software with no cloud dependency.**
